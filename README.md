# lusty94_weed

All credits go to original creators I have just reworked the script for my server to only spawn weed plants.

 ps-drugprocessing majorly reworked to only spawn weed plants and give an simple item when picked. Item can be used in crafting or whatever script you want.
 
 
# Insert to qb-core/shared/items.lua
 
 ["cannabis"] 			 		 = {["name"] = "cannabis", 						["label"] = "Cannabis", 				["weight"] = 250, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "cannabis.png", 			["unique"] = false, 	["useable"] = false, 	["shouldClose"] = true,	   ["combinable"] = nil,   ["description"] = "Some Stinky Cannabis"},
	
	
# Insert cannabis.png in images folder to your inventory script.../html/images
